    Windows Forms project, where I load some object made in blender and display it on screen.
    User can move camera around the scene using w/s/a/d keys and up/down/left/right keys.
    Object is colored and shaded (flat shading technique).

Controls:
Move camera in x/y axis -> up/down/left/right
Move camera in z axis/rotate ->w/s/a/d
